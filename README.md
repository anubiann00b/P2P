P2P
===

Implementation of a "true" P2P network.

By true I mean that all nodes run the exact same code. There is no master node. All nodes are created equal.

Java because I have experience in Java, and Java is pretty good for networking.

Will upload scanned documents at some point, but most of the idea is stored in my memory, which is being transferred into code.
